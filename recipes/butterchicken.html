    <ol>

        <li> In a large pan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering hot.</li>
        <li> Add chicken in batches and sear 2-3 minutes on each side. Set to side once done. </li>
        <li> Lower the same pan to medium heat, add a touch of more oil along with diced onions, 
            diced ginger, sliced garlic, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix and stir, 
            sauteing for 2-3 minutes or until softened.</li>
        <li> Add in spices (turmeric powder optional) and stir together until spices have toasted

        <li> After toasting, add in crushed tomatoes and water then stir until incorporated over medium heat. 
            Let simmer for 5-8 minutes until the sauce has reduced.</li>
